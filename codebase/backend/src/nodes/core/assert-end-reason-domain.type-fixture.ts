/**
 * Compile-time regression fixture for {@link AssertEndReasonDomain} — this is
 * **not** a runtime test and contains no `describe`/`it`.
 *
 * Why this file has to exist outside the `*.spec.ts` suite (code review
 * 2026-07-17 testing WARNING #1, `review/code/2026/07/17/22_58_45`):
 *  - backend `ts-jest` runs with `isolatedModules` — it strips types and does
 *    **not** type-check (verified: `const n: number = '문자열'` compiles
 *    clean under this test suite). A negative `@ts-expect-error` case placed
 *    in a `*.spec.ts` file would therefore never actually gate anything.
 *  - `tsconfig.build.json` (`nest build`) excludes `**\/*spec.ts`.
 *  - This file is plain `*.ts` under `src/**`, which `tsconfig.build.json`'s
 *    `"include": ["src/**\/*"]` picks up as a compilation root regardless of
 *    whether anything imports it — so `nest build` (tsc) type-checks it on
 *    every run. If `AssertEndReasonDomain` is ever accidentally weakened
 *    (e.g. the bidirectional `extends` check collapsed to one direction),
 *    the `@ts-expect-error` comments below stop matching a real error and
 *    `tsc` fails the build with "Unused '@ts-expect-error' directive".
 *
 * Not imported by any production module. Purely type-level — erased by tsc,
 * zero runtime footprint (`tsc --noEmit`-equivalent for this file's content).
 *
 * Reverse-verified when added: commenting out either `@ts-expect-error` line
 * below reproduces a real `nest build` TS2322 failure ("Type 'true' is not
 * assignable to type 'never'") — i.e. these directives are not vacuous.
