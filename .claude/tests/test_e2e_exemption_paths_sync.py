"""Guard: `e2e.yml`'s `paths-ignore` must stay inside PROJECT.md's e2e
exemption whitelist.

The two are a hand-synced pair. PROJECT.md §e2e 면제 화이트리스트 decides when a
*human or agent* may skip e2e; `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`'s `paths-ignore`
decides when *CI* skips it. Nothing bound them, and they had already drifted:
`.github/**` sat in the whitelist while the workflow lacked it, so every
CI-definition-only PR burned a full e2e run. That was fixed by hand in
`review/code/2026/07/23/16_02_39` I3 — value corrected, no guard added — and W3
of the same review deferred the guard rather than stack a third hand-written
parser onto a PR already criticised for two.

**The two directions are not equally dangerous, and this file treats them
differently.**

- `paths-ignore` WIDER than the whitelist → CI skips e2e for a change the
  policy says must run it. A real code change ships untested. **Hard failure.**
- `paths-ignore` NARROWER → CI runs e2e when it could have skipped. Wasteful,
  never unsafe. Allowed, but each such entry must be named in
  `UNMIRRORED_WHITELIST_ENTRIES` with a reason, so *adding* a whitelist entry
  forces a conscious decision about CI instead of silently diverging — which is
  exactly how the `.github/**` gap survived.

Parsing is stdlib-only (see `.claude/tests/README.md`) and both parsers take
**text**, not paths, so `ParserBoundaryTest` can pin the edges — inline
comments, quote styles, dedent — before the real files are ever read. Both
parsers also assert they found something, so a parser that silently returns
nothing fails loudly instead of passing vacuously.
