# `.claude/tests/` — harness self-tests

Unit tests for the **harness's own Python** (hooks, skill libs, config) — not
the product code under `codebase/`. These guard the automation layer that has
no other coverage: branch guards, branch normalization, and the multi-place
agent registry.

## Run

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s .claude/tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

No install step. The suite uses **only the standard library** (`unittest`,
`unittest.mock`), matching the harness convention that its Python carries zero
third-party dependencies — hooks must run on a bare `python3`. Do not introduce
`pytest`/`requirements.txt` here without revisiting that convention.

## What's covered

| File | Guards |
|---|---|
| `test_agent_consistency.py` | Registry drift across the 4 places an agent is declared: `role_instructions.py` (SSOT) ↔ `.claude/agents/<name>.md` ↔ `.claude.project.json` toggles ↔ `README.md` table. Catches add/rename/remove misses; does **not** police prose wording (the `.md` is an intentionally human-edited rendering). |
| `test_branch_guard.py` | `branch_guard.evaluate()` decision table — block only on (main worktree) ∧ (current == origin default); allow otherwise. Default branch is resolved, not hardcoded to `main`. |
| `test_branch_naming.py` | `worktree-*` → `claude/*` normalization: idempotent, skips main worktree / pushed branches / detached HEAD, appends a slug on collision. |
| `test_doc_sync_matrix.py` | PROJECT.md's "변경 유형 → 갱신 위치 매핑" matrix: every `*.test.ts` guard and `spec/...md` it references must still exist. Catches a renamed/removed guard going stale in the matrix. Reaches into `codebase/` and `spec/` on purpose (the matrix is a harness↔product binding). |

## Conventions for new tests

- Patch the git-backed helpers (`_repo_root`, `_run_git`, …), not git itself, so
  tests stay hermetic and fast.
- Load harness modules via `_harness.load_module_by_path` when they would
  collide on the shared `_lib` package name (the two `_lib` packages under
  `hooks/` and `skills/`). See `_harness.py`.
- Assert **structural / behavioral invariants**, not prose. The `.md` agent
  definitions and docs are allowed to read differently from their SSOT.
